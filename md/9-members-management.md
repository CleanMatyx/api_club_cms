API Endpoints
-------------

The Members Management system exposes five REST endpoints under the `/members` route prefix:

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose | Access Level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/members` | List all members (paginated) | Authenticated users |
| `POST` | `/members` | Create new member | Authenticated users |
| `GET` | `/members/{id}` | Get specific member details | Authenticated users |
| `PUT` | `/members/{id}` | Update existing member | Authenticated users |
| `DELETE` | `/members/{id}` | Delete member | Authenticated users |

### Pagination Configuration

The `index()` method implements pagination with 15 members per page:

```
$members = Member::paginate(15);

```

The paginated response includes metadata:

* `page`: Current page number
* `total_pages`: Total number of pages
* `total_members`: Total count of members

Data Flow and Request Processing

Access Control and Security
---------------------------

All member endpoints require authentication via Bearer token. The system enforces authentication through Laravel's middleware system.

### Authentication Requirements

Each endpoint includes security configuration:

```
security={{"bearerAuth":{}}}

```

Both regular users and administrators can access all member management operations, unlike other systems that restrict certain operations to admin-only access.

Error Handling
--------------

The `MemberController` implements comprehensive error handling with standardized response formats:

### Exception Types and Responses

| Exception | HTTP Status | Response Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ValidationException` | 422 | "Error de validaci√≥n" + field errors |
| `ModelNotFoundException` | 404 | "Miembro no encontrado" |
| Generic `Exception` | 500 | "Error interno del servidor" |

### Error Response Structure

All error responses follow a consistent format:

Validation and Data Integrity
-----------------------------

The system uses `MemberRequest` for validating incoming data in both create and update operations. The same validation rules apply to both `store()` and `update()` methods.

Related Systems Integration
---------------------------

The Members Management system integrates with several other subsystems:

* **Authentication System**: Requires valid Bearer tokens for all operations
* **User Management**: Members may be associated with user accounts
* **Reservations Management**: Members can create and manage reservations
* **Validation Framework**: Uses `MemberRequest` for data validation
* **Resource Formatting**: Uses `MemberResource` for consistent API responses
