## System Overview

The User Management system is implemented as an admin-only REST API that provides complete lifecycle management for user accounts. It integrates with the authentication system to manage user credentials and roles within the club management platform.

### User Management Architecture

## Access Control and Security

The User Management system implements strict role-based access control where all operations require administrator privileges. This ensures that only authorized personnel can manage user accounts and system access.

### Security Flow

## CRUD Operations

The `UserController` class implements standard REST operations for user management. Each operation includes comprehensive error handling and follows consistent response patterns.

### Operation Details

| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Controller Method | Purpose | Admin Only |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/v1/users` | `index()` | List all users with pagination | ✓ |
| POST | `/api/v1/users` | `store()` | Create new user account | ✓ |
| GET | `/api/v1/users/{id}` | `show()` | Get specific user details | ✓ |
| PUT | `/api/v1/users/{id}` | `update()` | Update existing user | ✓ |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/users/{id}` | `destroy()` | Delete user account | ✓ |

### User Listing (`index` method)

The listing operation provides paginated access to all user accounts in the system.

The response includes pagination metadata with 15 users per page and returns a 404 status when no users are available.

### User Creation (`store` method)

User creation handles password hashing and validation through the `UserRequest` class.

### User Updates (`update` method)

The update operation includes conditional password hashing - passwords are only hashed if provided in the request.

## Request Validation and Data Handling

The system uses Laravel's `UserRequest` class for consistent validation across create and update operations. This ensures data integrity and enforces business rules for user account creation.

### Password Security

* Passwords are automatically hashed using Laravel's `Hash::make()` method
* During updates, passwords are only re-hashed if a new password is provided
* Original password validation rules are enforced through `UserRequest`

## Error Handling

The controller implements comprehensive error handling for all operations:

### Error Response Types

| Error Code | Scenario | Example Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 401 | Unauthorized access | Token invalid or missing |
| 404 | User not found | User ID doesn't exist |
| 404 | No users available | Empty user list |
| 422 | Validation error | Invalid user data |
| 500 | Server error | Database or system failure |

Each method uses try-catch blocks to handle `ModelNotFoundException` and general `Exception` cases, providing consistent error responses throughout the API.

## Integration Points

The User Management system integrates with several other components:

* **Authentication System**: Users created here can authenticate via the OAuth2/Passport system
* **Members System**: User accounts may be linked to member profiles
* **Role-Based Access**: User roles determine access levels throughout the application

For details on how users authenticate after creation, see [Authentication & Authorization](). For member-user relationships, see [Members Management]().
